Simple Game inspired by Ryuta Kawashima's system

___

### Tech stack

I made this game to refresh my knowledge.  
Therefore I decided to use the most modern frontend technologies:

- React + TS
- Vite
- FC + React Hooks
- useContext and usePersistedState
- CSS variables, new logical variables (e.g. margin-block), CSS Grid
